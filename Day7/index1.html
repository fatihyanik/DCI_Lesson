            </header>
            <p>Atatürk’s full name is Mustafa Kemal Atatürk. He was born in Salonica in 1881. His father
                was Ali Rıza and his mother was Zübeyde. Atatürk‘s four of five siblings died at young ages.
                Only Makbule lived until 1956. When Mustafa was a school-age school, he started to study at
                Hafız Mehmet Efendi Local School. Then, he transferred to Şemsi Efendi School at his
                father’s instigation. Then he lost his father in 1888. He started Military High School
                (Askeri Rüştiye) in 1893. His mathematics teacher added “Kemal” to his name. He went to
                Samsun in 19th May 1919 and war of independence started. He was given the surname “Atatürk”
                by Grand National Assembly of Turkey in 1934. He died on 10th November 1938.</p>

                <h2 class="titleOfArticle">Education Life of Atatürk</h2>
                <p><em> Kemal Atatürk started his education life in 1887 in Thessaloniki, in the neighborhood
                        school. A few days later, he moved from the neighborhood school to Şemsi Efendi School. Later,
                        he enrolled in the Thessaloniki Rustiye, which provides education with a modern understanding of
                        education. He left this school after his father’s death.

                        Later, between 1893-1895, he started to receive secondary education at the Thessaloniki Military
                        Junior High School for military training.

                        His teachers and friends would see Mustafa Kemal as a mature and intelligent child. He stood out
                        among his friends for his intelligence and talent.

                        <mark> his education in Thessaloniki Military High School, Mustafa Kemal continued his education
                            in Manastir Military High School on 13 March 1896.</mark>

                        It should be noted that in addition to the importance Mustafa Kemal attaches to military
                        education, he also attaches great importance to foreign language learning. Returning to
                        Thessaloniki in the summer, Mustafa Kemal was taking French lessons here.

                        Mustafa Kemal, who successfully completed the Manastir Military High School, entered the
                        Military Academy in Istanbul on March 13, 1899. Here, too, he continued his success and left
                        with the rank of lieutenant.

                        Atatürk continued his education in the Military Academy and became a lieutenant in 1903. On
                        January 11, 1905, he graduated from the Military Academy with the rank of Staff Captain.

                        Mustafa Kemal has been a distinguished person at the Military School and the Military Academy by
                        his teachers with his abilities and personality. He was very interested in his lessons in
                        military service and besides this field, he also had a great interest in literature and the art
                        of eloquence. He showed himself as an enlightened and revolutionary officer in terms of
                        expressing his thoughts about the country easily.</em></p>

            </header>
            <p>Atatürk drank tea or coffee for breakfast, and did not eat much else. Some days he would complete his
                breakfast with cold buttermilk and a slice of bread. He also liked the cheese omelet very much.

                In addition to these, beans without meat and rice were one of his favorite dishes. Fava and asparagus
                were also among his favorite foods.

                Mustafa Kemal, who is not very close to dessert, distinguished semolina halva from the others and
                preferred it when he was going to eat dessert.</p>
